# Project 101 — Calculator with PyTest

A simple, well-tested Python `Calculator` class that supports basic arithmetic and helper operations. The calculator tracks the last computed result via `last_answer`, and includes a PyTest suite with coverage reporting.

## Project Description

- Provides `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide` operations.
- Includes helper methods `maximum` and `minimum`.
- Maintains a `last_answer` property updated after every successful operation.
- Tested with PyTest across integers, floats, negatives, and edge cases.
- Coverage reporting supported via `coverage` with HTML output.

## Installation

Prerequisites:
- Python 3.12+ recommended

Optional: create and activate a virtual environment (Windows):

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

```bash
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install development dependencies:

```bash
pip install -U pytest coverage
```

## Usage Examples

Basic usage:

```python
from calculator import Calculator

calc = Calculator()

print(calc.add(2, 3))        # 5
print(calc.last_answer)      # 5

print(calc.multiply(4, 2))   # 8
print(calc.last_answer)      # 8

print(calc.divide(7, 2))     # 3.5
print(calc.maximum(10, 7))   # 10
print(calc.minimum(3, 5))    # 3
```

Notes:
- `divide(a, b)` raises `ZeroDivisionError` when `b == 0`. In that case, `last_answer` is not changed.
- All operations update `last_answer` on success.

## Dependencies

- Runtime: Python standard library only (no third-party runtime dependencies).
- Development/Test:
  - `pytest` — unit testing framework
  - `coverage` — test coverage measurement

Install dev/test dependencies:

```bash
pip install -U pytest coverage
```

## Testing & Coverage

Run tests:

```bash
python -m pytest -q
```

Generate coverage data:

```bash
coverage run -m pytest
```

View coverage summary:

```bash
coverage report
```

Create HTML coverage report:

```bash
coverage html
```

Open the report: `htmlcov\index.html`

## Contribution Guidelines

- Fork the repo and create a feature branch (e.g., `feature/short-description`).
- Keep changes focused and aligned with the project’s simplicity.
- Add or update tests for any new behavior.
- Before opening a PR:
  - Run tests: `python -m pytest -q`
  - Check coverage: `coverage run -m pytest` + `coverage report`
  - Optionally generate HTML: `coverage html` and review `htmlcov\index.html`
- Use clear commit messages; reference issues if applicable.
- Submit a PR describing the change, rationale, and any trade-offs.
